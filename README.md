# StoryThread Tracker

Single-page log for tracking books, movies, and shows with a calendar and reflection feed. Built as a GitHub Pages-friendly static site (Jekyll just passes it through because of the front matter at the top of `index.html`).

## Getting Started
1. Create a new repo (or publish this folder) to GitHub.
2. Enable GitHub Pages with the root of `main` (or docs folder if you prefer) pointing to this directory.
3. Visit the Pages URL—localStorage persists your library/entries per browser.

You can also open `index.html` locally for quick testing.
